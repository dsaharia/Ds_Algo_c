## Data Structures and Algorithms in C

## Implementation of Data Structures and Design and analysis of Algorithms in C language.

##  Data Structures -
  * Linked List-
    * Number of Nodes, Printing Data in Nodes.
  * Stacks -
    * Using Arrays.
    * Using Pointers.
    * Using Linked Lists (To be modified using Reviews).
    * As a Parentheses Checker.(*using STL*).
    * Infix to Postfix converter.
  * Queue -
    * Using Arrays.
  * Binary Search tree.

## Algorithms -
 * Searching -
 	* Binary Search (Iterative).
 	* Binary Search (Recursive).
 	* Linear Search.
 * Sorting - 
 	* Insertion Sort.
 	* Selection Sort.
 	* Bubble Sort.
 	* Merge Sort.
 	* Quick Sort.
 * Divide and Conquer Algorithms -
 	* Finding Median of two sorted arrays along with the Kth smallest element.
 	* The Closest Pair problem.
 	* Element Inversion problem.
